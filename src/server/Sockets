Two Kind of sockets:

1. ServerSocket:
special socket that resides only on the server's side.
A.It binds to a specific port (on a specific IP address)
B.listens to requests for incoming connections
C.tries to accept them (In TCP - 3WAY Handshake)

2. Socket (a.k.a Operational Socket/Client Socket)
It is an abstraction of 2way data pipeline: the input stream and the outputstream
In client-side:
A.client creates a Socket using a specific IP address, port number and Transport protocol
 (by default TCP)
B. if a connection is accepted by the server, we can send and receive data using the socket
In server-side:
for every accepted connection (using ServerSocket), a Socket is created
for each client
